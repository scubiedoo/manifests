# Motivation
I found myself testing image over image on my cubieboard2, searching THE image that fits all my needs.
Everytime there was something that didn't work.
While reading a thread on the cubieforums.com, the idea popped up to take a distro and make it customizable for everybody,
but still have developers to improve the overall as a whole.

I am using Ubuntu ever since, so my first choice was a Ubuntu based image, namely cubiuntu.
